## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
## SOCIAL MEDIA APP

Developed by me using Nextjs and Context. Some of the datum come from a json file
and others one, like, images, from an api.

Completly responsive page; but still need some adjustments on the routes; btw
I haven't use the new system of route pages of next. I've used <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">react-router-dom</a>
